It's a rock, paper, scissors game

This is one of my exercises from Udemy online Course: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu

Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a Python script that plays a rock-paper-scissors game against the user.
The game is played by the user entering their choice (0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors) and the computer making a random selection.
The winner of each round is determined by comparing the user's and computer's choices, based on the rules of RPS,
and the results are displayed after all rounds have been played.

What are the rules of RPS?

Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

Rock wins against scissors.
Scissors win against paper.
Paper wins against rock.
