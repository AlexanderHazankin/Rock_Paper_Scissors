This is one of my exercises from Udemy online Course: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu

This script is a simple rock-paper-scissors game that allows you to play against a computer.
It starts by greeting the player and asking for their name.
Then it explains the rules of the game and asks how many rounds the player would like to play.
The game is played in a tournament format, and the user can enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors by entering 0, 1, or 2, respectively.
The computer then makes a random choice and the winner of each round is determined based on the standard rules of rock-paper-scissors.
At the end of the tournament, the results are printed and the overall winner is determined.
